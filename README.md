# Blind Auction Program

## Introduction
This is a Python program designed for a secret blind auction. The program collects the names and bids of different people, asking for each bidder's name and their bid individually. It then determines the winner and displays their name along with the winning bid.

## Instructions

1. Run the program and provide your name.
2. Enter your bid when prompted.
3. Indicate if there are other bidders by typing 'yes' or 'no'.
4. If there are more bidders, the screen will clear for the next person.
5. If there are no more bidders, the program will display the name of the winner and their winning bid.

## Usage

Ensure that you have the "replit" module installed to clear the console. If you're not using replit (e.g., using VSCode or PyCharm), you may need to create your own clear function or configure your IDE accordingly.

### Example
```python

# Run the program
python project.py

Welcome to the secret auction program.
What is your name?: Angela
What's your bid?: $123
Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no'. yes

# Screen clears for the next person

Welcome to the secret auction program.
What is your name?: Elon
What's your bid?: $55000000000
Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no'. no

The winner is Elon with a bid of $55000000000
